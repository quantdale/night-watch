Phase: SUCCESSOR_CAMPAIGN_ENGINE_V1
Title: Fresh successor campaign engine and reassessment
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Task directory: .agent/tasks/nightwatch-successor-campaign-engine-v1
Starting SHA: 78efcc9c4cd02498a0b4bd1d01fb5112d03a1bd1
Last validated implementation SHA: c83e9d438b2a7e36db6a5c79345f5405c980bffc
Last checkpoint: 2026-09-25 — shard temp isolation c83e9d43; focused/adversarial green and corrected gate:dev retains only 12 source-drift failures.
Current milestone: M8 — implement shard temporary-namespace isolation.
Next action: run clean `gate:milestone`, classify the exact residual, then close or block the isolation child.

## Mission

Reassess the certified baseline from current repository evidence, rank the
remaining authorized local work by impact, confidence, executability, and risk,
then execute the strongest coherent successor campaign. Reassess and repeat
while useful authorized work remains. Preserve the completed priority campaign
as historical truth; do not reopen it.

## Read order

1. `.agent/tasks/nightwatch-successor-campaign-engine-v1/{SPEC,PLAN,STATE}.md`
2. `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/SAFETY_MODEL.md`, and
   `docs/DECISIONS.md`
3. Current audit/OpenSpec ledgers and cited live source
4. The selected campaign's dedicated artifacts, when a safe selection is made

## Routing and safety

CAMPAIGN: nightwatch-successor-campaign-engine-v1
CHILD TASK: nightwatch-shard-temp-isolation-v1
SESSION WORKTREE: session/nightwatch-successor-campaign-en-628d8bb9

IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORIZED:
  Nightwatch source, tests, hardening rules/probes, schemas/configuration,
  synthetic Git/browser/network fixtures, synthetic private-data markers,
  local bounded child processes, OpenSpec/task continuity records,
  C-00 commits and fast-forward integration from this session only.

CURRENT STATUS:
  IN_PROGRESS — credential-use binding is checkpointed/BLOCKED by the independent
  live-source residual; shard temporary-namespace isolation is the active child.
