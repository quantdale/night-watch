## Routing and safety

This is a new bounded owner-authorized DEV requalification successor. It
preserves the existing `OPERATIONALLY_ACCEPTED` project verdict through the
explicit `PROJECT_VERDICT_EFFECT: PRESERVE` while collecting read-only
evidence. The task is limited to the existing guarded DEV launchers, serial
observations, sanitized owner-local evidence, and local regression repair only
if a Nightwatch defect is found.

No production, NEXT, DEV mutation, data/infra, sibling write, publication,
credential capture, raw authenticated evidence, containment weakening, or
retry-based correctness claim is authorized.
