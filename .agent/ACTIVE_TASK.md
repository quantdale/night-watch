Task ID: nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1
Phase: FINAL_PRODUCT_COMPLETION_V1
Title: Final product completion (terminal campaign)
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Task directory: .agent/tasks/nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1
Starting SHA: 1f786a4e1b7e4967d06c930946f1107e32931e8a
Last validated implementation SHA: 1f786a4e1b7e4967d06c930946f1107e32931e8a
Last checkpoint: 2026-09-26 — M3 tasks 4.1-4.6 complete; gate:dev PASS
5485/0 with per-shard skip-identity enforcement.
Current milestone: M3 spine, remainder (tasks 4.7-4.13) — sibling-absent
gate:clean, gate:topology certification, UI gate group, HANDOFF_TRUTH
session-declared classification, pinned CI runtime, session closeout fixes,
then milestone gates + checkpoint push + CI observation.
Next action: commit the 4.1-4.6 checkpoint, then implement tasks 4.7-4.13
in order and finish M3 with gate:milestone PASS plus a canonical-routed
push observed with `gh` (OD-3).

## Mission

Execute the single terminal campaign that makes an honest
`PROJECT_COMPLETE_AND_CI_CERTIFIED` verdict reachable and stable (OD-1/OD-2):
disposition every audited census item, make the certification spine
checkpoint-neutral and CI-green, persist truthful autonomous-hunt results,
reconcile every operator-truth surface, close the ledger, and end with a
`main`-only clean topology equal to `origin/main`.

## Read order

1. `.agent/tasks/nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1/{SPEC,PLAN,STATE}.md`
2. `openspec/changes/nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1/{proposal,design,audit,tasks}.md`
3. `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/SAFETY_MODEL.md`, and
   `docs/DECISIONS.md`
4. Current audit/OpenSpec ledgers and cited live source

## Routing and safety

CHILD TASK: NONE
SESSION WORKTREE: session/nightwatch-final-product-complet-a891357d

IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORIZED:
  Nightwatch source, tests, hardening rules/probes, schemas/configuration,
  synthetic Git/browser/network fixtures, synthetic private-data markers,
  local bounded child processes, OpenSpec/task continuity records,
  C-00 commits and fast-forward integration from this session only.

EXTERNAL CONTACT AUTHORIZED (OD-3 ONLY):
  GitHub Actions read/observe; C-00 fast-forward pushes; one bounded paid
  provider proof run; one npm registry advisory query.

CURRENT STATUS:
  IN_PROGRESS — M1 session bootstrap in the owned worktree.

Never force-push, never rebase or amend another agent's commits, never discard
a newer canonical tip, and never touch another owner's worktree. Do not claim
completion, exhaustion, or release readiness without evidence.
