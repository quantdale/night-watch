# Active Task

Task ID: nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1
Phase: FINAL_PRODUCT_COMPLETION_V1
Title: Final product completion (terminal campaign)
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Task directory: .agent/tasks/nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1
Starting SHA: 1f786a4e1b7e4967d06c930946f1107e32931e8a
Last validated implementation SHA: 1f786a4e1b7e4967d06c930946f1107e32931e8a
Last checkpoint: 2026-09-25 — M1 complete: bootstrap checkpoint `ec6010a2`;
all four activation checks PASS post-commit.
Current milestone: M2 certification anchors and ratchets (tasks 3.1-3.7) —
checkpoint-neutral evidence bindings and LIVE_TASK_STATUS derivation before
any evidence binding (A-01, R2-N6).
Next action: implement tasks 3.1-3.7 (census literal derivation, binding
files behind a diff-shape guard, hardening probe, project:check assertions,
ceiling ratchet, disposition-token ledger), run focused suites plus the
gates, and commit the M2 milestone.

## Mission

Execute the single terminal campaign that makes an honest
`PROJECT_COMPLETE_AND_CI_CERTIFIED` verdict reachable and stable (OD-1/OD-2):
disposition every audited census item, make the certification spine
checkpoint-neutral and CI-green, persist truthful autonomous-hunt results,
reconcile every operator-truth surface, close the ledger, and end with a
`main`-only clean topology equal to `origin/main`.

## Read order

1. `.agent/tasks/nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1/{SPEC,PLAN,STATE}.md`
2. `openspec/changes/nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1/{proposal,design,audit,tasks}.md`
3. `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/SAFETY_MODEL.md`, and
   `docs/DECISIONS.md`
4. Current audit/OpenSpec ledgers and cited live source

IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORIZED:
  Nightwatch source, tests, hardening rules/probes, schemas/configuration,
  synthetic Git/browser/network fixtures, synthetic private-data markers,
  local bounded child processes, OpenSpec/task continuity records,
  C-00 commits and fast-forward integration from this session only.

EXTERNAL CONTACT AUTHORIZED (OD-3 ONLY):
  GitHub Actions read/observe; C-00 fast-forward pushes; one bounded paid
  provider proof run; one npm registry advisory query.

CURRENT STATUS:
  IN_PROGRESS — M1 session bootstrap in the owned worktree.
