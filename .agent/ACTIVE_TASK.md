Task ID: nightwatch-successor-campaign-engine-v1
Phase: SUCCESSOR_CAMPAIGN_ENGINE_V1
Title: Fresh successor campaign engine and reassessment
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Task directory: .agent/tasks/nightwatch-successor-campaign-engine-v1
Starting SHA: 78efcc9c4cd02498a0b4bd1d01fb5112d03a1bd1
Last validated implementation SHA: 361a1506f4635b3180d0712529f75f7ebd939dbb
Last checkpoint: 2026-09-24 — shard and census children blocked with classified residuals; run-evidence transaction successor selected.
Current milestone: M4 — execute run-evidence transaction integrity child.
Next action: strict-validate the new child OpenSpec, add failing same-run/durable-state regressions, then implement the bounded fail-closed recorder fix.

## Mission

Reassess the certified baseline from current repository evidence, rank the
remaining authorized local work by impact, confidence, executability, and risk,
then execute the strongest coherent successor campaign. Reassess and repeat
while useful authorized work remains. Preserve the completed priority campaign
as historical truth; do not reopen it.

## Read order

1. `.agent/tasks/nightwatch-successor-campaign-engine-v1/{SPEC,PLAN,STATE}.md`
2. `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/SAFETY_MODEL.md`, and
   `docs/DECISIONS.md`
3. Current audit/OpenSpec ledgers and cited live source
4. The selected campaign's dedicated artifacts, when a safe selection is made

## Routing and safety

CAMPAIGN: nightwatch-successor-campaign-engine-v1
CHILD TASK: nightwatch-run-evidence-transaction-successor-v1
SESSION WORKTREE: session/nightwatch-successor-campaign-en-628d8bb9

IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORIZED:
  Nightwatch source, tests, hardening rules/probes, schemas/configuration,
  synthetic Git/browser/network fixtures, synthetic private-data markers,
  local bounded child processes, OpenSpec/task continuity records,
  C-00 commits and fast-forward integration from this session only.

CURRENT STATUS:
  IN_PROGRESS — canonical is clean and workspace status passes; shard and census
  children are BLOCKED by classified broad-gate residuals; run-evidence
  transaction integrity is the active independent successor.
