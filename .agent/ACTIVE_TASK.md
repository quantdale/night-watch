Task ID: nightwatch-final-completion-corrections-v1
Phase: COMPLETION_CORRECTIONS_V1
Title: Corrective campaign (child of the terminal campaign)
CHILD OF: nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Task directory: .agent/tasks/nightwatch-final-completion-corrections-v1
Starting SHA: 1d47e2eef1ef029560ace12e31571624602eab0b
Last validated implementation SHA: c736ab9b3534bf879ae730856e717546cfaa0b0b
Last checkpoint: 2026-09-28 — VC-01 skip correction at clean checkpoint
`c736ab9b`; the exact committed tree passed the 34-test DEV-login/storage-state
suite with all four browser-backed assertions executed and 0 skips. Exact-head
GitHub Actions proof remains pending the M4 group integration.
Previous checkpoint: 2026-09-28 — M3 continuity close-out at `14eb864a`; the
M3 implementation checkpoint `d6fd98b1` passed focused validation and both
group gates (5773 executed, 0 failed, 33 skipped; runtime targets disclosed).
Current milestone: M4 Validation spine (group 3, tasks 3.1-3.12: VC-01..VC-11).
M1, M2, and M3 are COMPLETE.
Next action: proceed to task 3.2 (skip-identity enforcement). VC-01's stale
skip guards and allowlist entries are removed; all four browser-backed tests
passed locally, with exact-head GitHub Actions proof pending M4 close-out.

## Mission

EXTERNAL CONTACT AUTHORIZED (OD-3 ONLY):
  GitHub Actions read/observe; C-00 fast-forward pushes; one bounded paid
  provider proof run; one npm registry advisory query.

Never force-push, never rebase or amend another agent's commits, never discard
a newer canonical tip, and never touch another owner's worktree. Do not claim
completion without evidence. Never write under the canonical checkout while
this session is live; if canonical becomes dirty, STOP and report the exact
files and mtimes.
