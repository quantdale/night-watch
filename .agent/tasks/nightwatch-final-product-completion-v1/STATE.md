## Objective

Execute the terminal campaign `nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1`
(tasks.md phases 1-15): disposition every audited census item (OD-1), make the
certification spine checkpoint-neutral and CI-green, persist truthful
autonomous-hunt results, reconcile every operator-truth surface, close the
ledger, and end at `PROJECT_COMPLETE_AND_CI_CERTIFIED` under D-129 with a
`main`-only clean topology (OD-2).

## Current Milestone

M2 certification anchors and ratchets (tasks 3.1-3.7) — make evidence
bindings, document-role corrections and LIVE_TASK_STATUS checkpoint-neutral
before any evidence binding (A-01, R2-N6), with the project:check evidence
assertions, the bin type-check ceiling ratchet and the disposition-token
ledger guard.

## Completed Milestones

- **M0 COMPLETE** — owner pre-flight on canonical: drift recorded in
  audit.md (1.1); canonical record re-pointed to this task (1.2, A-04);
  orphan branch `1441cc8a` recorded and deleted (1.3, A-06); MAINTENANCE
  claim released, planning material moved to the session scratchpad,
  canonical verified clean with `workspace:check` PASS (1.4).
- **M1 COMPLETE** — session bootstrap: `sess-0734f2070d08` on
  `session/nightwatch-final-product-complet-a891357d` at base `1f786a4e`;
  planning change and continuity committed together as bootstrap checkpoint
  `ec6010a2`; session:check PASS, handoff:check PASS, agent:check PASS
  (35 legacy warnings), project:check PASS post-commit.

## Work In Progress

- M2 task 3.1: derive LIVE_TASK_STATUS from `.agent/ACTIVE_TASK.md` and
  remove the literal from `src/core/source/censusFigureLedger.ts:290`.

## Exact Next Action

Implement M2 tasks 3.1-3.7 in order (census literal derivation, the two
checkpoint-neutral binding files behind a diff-shape guard, the hardening
probe, project:check evidence assertions, the bin type-check ceiling ratchet,
the disposition-token ledger guard), then focused suites plus `gate:dev` and
`gate:milestone`, record exact results, and commit the M2 milestone.

## Validation Ledger

Command: `git fetch origin` + `git rev-parse HEAD origin/main`
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary: no remote movement; `HEAD == origin/main ==
1f786a4e1b7e4967d06c930946f1107e32931e8a`; single canonical worktree; orphan
branch `session/nightwatch-successor-campaign-en-c8bcb74c` present.

Command: `npm run project:check`
Result: FAIL (EXPECTED, OD-4)
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary:
`PROJECT_STATE_ACTIVE_TASK_CONTINUITY_FAILED`; release verdict
`nightwatch.release-certification.v1` OPERATIONALLY_ACCEPTED; conditions
met=0/16; certificationRefused=true; checkpoint `87c4506f`. Matches the
audit's predicted baseline exactly.

Command: `npm run agent:check`
Result: FAIL (EXPECTED, OD-4)
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary: 1 error
`LEDGER_CHANGE_WITHOUT_TASK` (change `nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1`
had no task STATE yet at measurement time); legacy warnings unchanged.

Command: `npm run workspace:status` / `npm run status:local`
Result: PASS / MEASURED
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary: workspace invariants all PASS,
clean=false (untracked planning dir, OD-4 state); `status:local` reports the
change as MISSING_TASK open=113; drift recorded in audit.md.

Command: `openspec validate nightwatch-final-product-completion-v1 --strict`
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary: Change is valid (113 tasks, 7 delta specs).

Command: `git show session/nightwatch-successor-campaign-en-c8bcb74c`
Result: PASS (A-06)
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary: tip `1441cc8a` verified as the single
docs-only BLOCKED record commit before `git branch -D` under OD-3.

Command: `node bin/nightwatch-session.mjs claim/release` (canonical MAINTENANCE)
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary: `sess-200ba55d7757` adopted from
`sess-36dedce34085`, naming this task (A-04), then released after the
continuity staging bound it; canonical clean afterwards with
`workspace:check` PASS (attention=0).

Command: `node bin/nightwatch-session.mjs start/claim` (session worktree)
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary: worktree
`nightwatch-final-product-complet-a891357d`, branch
`session/nightwatch-final-product-complet-a891357d`, base `1f786a4e`,
session `sess-0734f2070d08`; claim adopted the created registration.

Command: `npm run session:check` (worktree)
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary: OWNED_SESSION, drift=false, attention=0,
canonicalSafe=true; worktree dirty only with the staged bootstrap content.

Command: `npm run handoff:check` (worktree)
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary: planner-handoff receipt status PASS;
OpenSpec route files tracked; Planned-From `1f786a4e` is a main ancestor.

Command: `npm run agent:check` (worktree)
Result: PASS (35 legacy warnings)
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary: 0 strict errors after the STATE heading set
was completed and the stray slash-joined command list was rephrased out of
ACTIVE_TASK; warnings are the known historical LEDGER_TASK_WITHOUT_CHANGE
population.

Command: `npm run project:check` (worktree, pre-commit)
Result: FAIL (EXPECTED, pre-commit)
When: 2026-09-25
Relevant failure/output summary:
`PROJECT_STATE_CHECKOUT_DIRTY` — the bootstrap content is staged but not yet
committed; every other section reproduced the certified-baseline detail with
ledger_errors=0 (OD-4's LEDGER_CHANGE_WITHOUT_TASK resolved). Re-run after
the bootstrap commit.

## Decisions Made During This Task

- 2026-09-25 — Adopt the released canonical MAINTENANCE record for this task
  and release it inside P0, staging the continuity record transiently in
  canonical because `release` binds continuity against
  `.agent/ACTIVE_TASK.md` + `.agent/tasks/<id>/STATE.md` bytes (measured
  `SESSION_CONTINUITY_MISMATCH` otherwise; authority:
  `bin/lib/session-authority.mjs admitContinuity`, commit `b0f9b1f2`).
  Consequence: canonical ended P0 clean with the released record naming this
  task; the full continuity is committed in this M1 bootstrap checkpoint.
- 2026-09-25 — `PROJECT_VERDICT_EFFECT: PRESERVE` (D-98 semantics): the
  project state projects `OPERATIONALLY_ACCEPTED`, which an IN_PROGRESS task
  may preserve only with PRESERVE; the D-129 terminal verdict is claimed only
  at S.

## Discoveries

- P0 pre-flight reproduced the audited baseline exactly; one stale figure in
  the audit's live-truth table (`status:local sees 75`; measured 188 open
  items across 5 campaigns) is corrected in audit.md's drift record.
- `release` continuity admission makes the literal P0 ordering require the
  transient activation staging described above; tasks.md 1.4's two hard
  requirements (released claim, clean canonical) are both satisfied by it.
- `agent:check` requires the full STATE heading set (including
  `## Decisions Made During This Task`, `## Discoveries`, `## Blockers`,
  `## Deferred / Follow-Up`, `## Resume Recipe`, `## Completion Snapshot`) and
  the routing checker reads every `session/...` token in ACTIVE_TASK as a
  worktree reference, so slash-joined command lists must not look like
  `session/...` paths.

## Blockers

None.

## Safety Events

None. No Alphaus environment, database, cloud, credential, or external
publication contact; no sibling repository mutation; no force push or history
rewrite. External contact so far: `git fetch` (read) only.

## Deferred / Follow-Up

- T2-GATE contained-DEV redesigns (NW-AUD-016 full, 025 full, 026, 037, 038):
  quarantined behind the DEV-lane precondition registry (M8).
- TF external prerequisites (production track C-12/C-13/C-14/P4, DEV storage
  re-capture, ripple-api re-admission, owner-gated legacy migration): owner
  actions with revisit triggers, recorded per OD-1.

## Resume Recipe

Resume from this file: read `.agent/ACTIVE_TASK.md`, then the change's
`tasks.md` (phases 1-15) and `audit.md` dispositions, reconcile against
`git status` and the session record, run the smallest decisive validation,
and continue the Exact Next Action. All work happens in the session worktree
named in the routing block; integration is fast-forward only.

## Completion Snapshot

Not complete. Terminal snapshot is written at M14: all 228 census items
dispositioned (OD-1), `PROJECT_COMPLETE_AND_CI_CERTIFIED` under D-129 with CI
`EXECUTED_PASS` at S (OD-2), operator proofs recorded, ledger closed, and a
`main`-only clean topology equal to `origin/main`.
