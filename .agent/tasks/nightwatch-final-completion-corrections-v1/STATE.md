## Objective

Close the corrective change's 39 tasks (phases 1-6), re-verifying every
audit finding at the parent base `1d47e2ee`, so the parent campaign resumes
from sound foundations at M9 task 10.2 (remainder: 59/76 declared).

## Current Milestone

Milestone ID: M4

M1 (bootstrap + Phase 1 preconditions), M2 (task 6.1 formatter policy,
landed FIRST per RESUME_PROMPT §2), and M3 (certification anchors, tasks
2.1-2.8) are COMPLETE. M4 validation spine (tasks 3.1-3.12) is IN_PROGRESS.

## Completed Milestones

- **M1 COMPLETE** — bootstrap and Phase 1 preconditions (tasks 1.1-1.3):
  the corrective change restored unchanged and committed together with
  continuity v2 (`3ce396c6`); the parent session checkpointed at `1d47e2ee`
  with resume point "M9 task 10.2 (remainder: 59/76 declared)" and
  exact-head CI run 36366426608 green at `32180001`, released and removed
  with the branch reachability proof (1.1); the 16 canonical files
  owner-dispositioned disposable (AST-equivalent to `df0a6d35`) and
  restored under the explicit owner authorization, pi-lens mutation
  controls disabled (`~/.pi-lens/config.json` + project `.pi-lens.json` at
  `/home/dalepalaca/go/src/` and `~/.nightwatch/`), `workspace:check` PASS
  (`canonicalSafe=true`) (1.2); all 31 findings re-verified at `1d47e2ee`
  with file:line evidence — 21 STILL_PRESENT, 5 CHANGED, 2 COMPLETED_LATER
  (VB-04 and VD-05's rule @ `a784e668`), 3 follow-on defects CF-01..CF-03
  (1.3).
- **M3 COMPLETE** — certification anchors (tasks 2.1-2.8, VB-01..VB-07):
  VB-07 baseline 1579 diagnostics / 13 of 76 entry points, 78 exact ceilings,
  total 1579, annotation budget 26; 45/45 focused ratchet/CLI tests plus
  clean-tree project-state regression 1/1. `gate:dev` PASS and
  `gate:milestone` PASS at `d6fd98b1`; both conservatively selected all 438
  unit tests, 5773 executed, 5740 passed, 0 failed, 33 skipped. Milestone
  also passed `typecheck:bin`, `hardening:rules`, `project:check`, and
  `workspace:check`. `withinTarget=false` for both lanes (782447/120000 ms and
  1337343/300000 ms); selection was not narrowed.

## Work In Progress

- **M2 (task 6.1) COMPLETE** — the repository formatter policy landed FIRST
  per RESUME_PROMPT §2: `biome.json` (formatter + organize-imports + linter
  off), `.editorconfig` pinning the normalizers off and declaring only the
  corpus byte invariants that hold, and `tests/unit/formatterPolicy.test.ts`
  5/5 with a positive control (formatter-enabled config rewrites the probe)
  and a whole-tracked-corpus `check --write` no-op over a disposable
  `git ls-files` copy with before/after hashes. The pinned
  `@biomejs/biome@2.5.14` installed offline (cache-only), the disposable
  `npm ci --offline` verification re-executed (10 packages, lockfile
  byte-identical), and dependency-currency + the matrix carry the honest
  advisory-scope limit. Focused suites green (formatterPolicy 5/5;
  nw14/nw08/executionClasses/nw07/c16 149/149 with the known clean-tree
  `projectState:2316` exception on the dirty worktree); hardening:check,
  handoff:check, agent:check and typecheck all PASS.
- Lint follow-through in the same checkpoint: the dead `loadTypeScriptModule`
  wrappers in `bin/ai-local-canary.mjs` and `bin/auth-configure.mjs` are
  removed (both call sites already use `loadRuntimeTypeScriptModule`
  directly) — this is the fix the harness autofix kept re-applying in
  canonical, now landing legitimately through the C-00 integrate.
- **M4 IN_PROGRESS — validation spine (tasks 3.1-3.12, VC-01..VC-11).**
  The first action is task 3.1: ensure the four DEV-login/storage-state
  security tests resolve the configured Chrome channel and execute rather
  than skip; confirm exact CI evidence as specified. Then continue the
  remaining spine corrections in stable task-ID order.

## Exact Next Action

Implement M4 task 3.1: inspect the DEV-login and storage-state skip guards,
resolve the configured Chrome channel executable (or remove the stale skip),
add focused proof that the four security tests execute, and obtain allowed
GitHub Actions evidence showing they passed rather than skipped. Continue
VC-02..VC-11 in task order, validate the M4 group, and record every checkpoint.

## Validation Ledger

Command: `npm run workspace:check` (canonical, pre-bootstrap)
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant failure/output summary: `canonicalSafe=true`, clean tree at
`1d47e2ee`; the 16 owner-dispositioned files restored under RESUME_PROMPT
§1 authorization; pi-lens mutation controls disabled.

Command: re-verification of all 31 audit findings at `1d47e2ee` (read-only)
Result: PASS (recorded in `audit.md`'s re-verification table)
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant failure/output summary: 21 STILL_PRESENT, 5 CHANGED, 2
COMPLETED_LATER (VB-04 and VD-05's rule @ `a784e668`), 3 follow-on defects
(CF-01..CF-03) where later parent work built on a defective surface.

Command: `npm run agent:check` (this worktree, pre-bootstrap)
Result: PASS (pending this bootstrap commit's continuity headings)
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant failure/output summary: strict errors listed the missing
continuity headings (## Deferred Work, ## Completion Criteria, ## Files
Changed, ## Validation Ledger) — added before the bootstrap commit.

Command: focused ratchet/CLI suites, `npm run typecheck`,
`npm run typecheck:bin`, `npm run validation:universe`, and
`node bin/validation-execution-classes.mjs`
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant failure/output summary: 45/45 Playwright tests; root typecheck clean;
bin lane PASS at 13/76, 1579 diagnostics, 78 exact ceilings, total ceiling
1579, annotation budget 26; universe 580 discovered / 0 unclassified at
`901b155e`; all 438 executable unit tests have valid non-weakening classes.

Command: `npm run gate:dev -- --json` (pre-checkpoint candidate tree)
Result: FAIL (clean-checkout-dependent test; retry required)
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant failure/output summary: affected selection broadened to 438 tests;
5773 executed, 5739 passed, 1 failed, 33 skipped, 0 not-run. The sole failure
is `tests/unit/projectState.test.ts:2390`, whose real-tree check emits
`PROJECT_STATE_CHECKOUT_DIRTY` on stderr and no stdout under DEV_LANE while
the worktree is dirty. The test's missing execution class and first digest
drift were fixed; a later clean-checkpoint run exposed the helper's missing
BIN_SYNTAX classification (recorded below). No test or safety condition was
weakened.

Command: `npm run gate:dev -- --json` (after checkpoint `80840627`)
Result: STEP_FAILED at `validation-universe`; correction in progress
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant failure/output summary: clean checkout let the lane reach its first
required step, where `bin/lib/typecheck-ratchet.mjs` was unclassified and the
stored inventory digest had drifted. Added the helper to BIN_SYNTAX and
measured digest `901b155e` (580 discovered, 0 unclassified); that correction
was committed as `d6fd98b1` before the successful retries below.

Command: clean-checkout `projectState.test.ts` real-tree regression at
`d6fd98b10ac810128e7ed244c31c213e4d3fc72b`
Result: PASS (1/1)
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant output: the real project-state check produced its expected stdout
and every release-check probe resolved to carried output.

Command: `npm run gate:dev -- --json` at `d6fd98b10ac810128e7ed244c31c213e4d3fc72b`
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant output: 3 shards; 5773 planned/executed, 5740 passed, 0 failed,
33 skipped, 0 not-run; coverage true; 782447 ms against the 120000 ms
telemetry target (`withinTarget=false`); affected selection broadened to all
438 tests (`AFFECTED_BROADENED`).

Command: `npm run gate:milestone -- --json` at `d6fd98b10ac810128e7ed244c31c213e4d3fc72b`
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant output: all steps exit 0, including `typecheck:bin`,
`hardening:rules`, `project-check`, and `workspace-check`; 3 shards;
5773 planned/executed, 5740 passed, 0 failed, 33 skipped, 0 not-run; coverage
true; 1337343 ms against the 300000 ms telemetry target (`withinTarget=false`);
all 438 tests selected. No selection narrowing was applied.

## Decisions Made During This Task

- M3 gate acceptance follows each lane's explicit JSON `result`: both are
  PASS, while `withinTarget=false` remains disclosed performance telemetry.
  The affected-test selector broadened to all 438 tests and no selection or
  safety criterion was narrowed.

## Discoveries

- The 31 audit findings were re-verified at `1d47e2ee`; VB-04 and VD-05's
  rule landed in the parent's `a784e668` (COMPLETED_LATER) and 5 findings
  CHANGED shape. Three follow-on defects (CF-01/CF-02/CF-03) were recorded:
  later parent work (M5-M9) built on the VD-01/VD-03 foundations.
- VB-07's initial draft only ratcheted the 76 top-level entry points; the
  correction expands the per-file map to every `.mjs` and `.d.mts` included
  by `tsconfig.bin.json`, including diagnostic-bearing `bin/lib` modules.
  Gate validation confirmed the new test needs execution-class and
  validation-universe registration, and the new helper needs BIN_SYNTAX
  classification before broad validation can pass.
- Both M3 lanes completed the broadened 438-test selection with full coverage
  and zero failures; `withinTarget=false` was emitted by both lane receipts
  because the suite took 782447 ms / 1337343 ms respectively. This is retained
  as a performance follow-up without narrowing the selection or changing the
  task's explicit PASS criterion.

## Blockers

None.

## Safety Events

No Alphaus environment, database, cloud, credential, or external publication
contact; no sibling repository mutation; no force push or history rewrite;
all testing local/synthetic. External contact is OD-3 only. The owner
authorized one restore command (`git checkout -- <the 16 files>`) in
canonical on 2026-09-28 (RESUME_PROMPT §1); canonical was verified clean
afterwards.

## Deferred / Follow-Up

- The parent's M9-M14 work (10.2 remainder, 10.3-10.6, M10-M14) stays in
  the parent campaign after this child closes.

## Resume Recipe

Resume from this file: read `.agent/ACTIVE_TASK.md`, then this task's
`SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md`, `STATE.md`, and the change's `tasks.md`/`audit.md`;
reconcile against `git status` and the session record; run the smallest
decisive validation; continue the Next Action. All work happens in the
session worktree named in the routing block; integration is fast-forward
only; never write under the canonical checkout while this session is live.

## Completion Snapshot

Not complete. Terminal snapshot is written at close-out (task 6.4): every
finding dispositioned with evidence, ACTIVE_TASK routed back to the parent
at IN_PROGRESS with Next action "M9 task 10.2 remainder", and the change
archived with `--skip-specs`.
