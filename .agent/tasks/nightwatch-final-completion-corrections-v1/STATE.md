## Objective

Close the corrective change's 39 tasks (phases 1-6), re-verifying every
audit finding at the parent base `1d47e2ee`, so the parent campaign resumes
from sound foundations at M9 task 10.2 (remainder: 59/76 declared).

## Current Milestone

Milestone ID: M3

M3 Certification anchors (group 2, tasks 2.1-2.8: VB-01..VB-07). M1
(bootstrap + Phase 1 preconditions) and M2 (task 6.1 formatter policy,
landed FIRST per RESUME_PROMPT §2) are COMPLETE — see Work In Progress and
the Validation Ledger.

## Completed Milestones

- **M1 COMPLETE** — bootstrap and Phase 1 preconditions (tasks 1.1-1.3):
  the corrective change restored unchanged and committed together with
  continuity v2 (`3ce396c6`); the parent session checkpointed at `1d47e2ee`
  with resume point "M9 task 10.2 (remainder: 59/76 declared)" and
  exact-head CI run 36366426608 green at `32180001`, released and removed
  with the branch reachability proof (1.1); the 16 canonical files
  owner-dispositioned disposable (AST-equivalent to `df0a6d35`) and
  restored under the explicit owner authorization, pi-lens mutation
  controls disabled (`~/.pi-lens/config.json` + project `.pi-lens.json` at
  `/home/dalepalaca/go/src/` and `~/.nightwatch/`), `workspace:check` PASS
  (`canonicalSafe=true`) (1.2); all 31 findings re-verified at `1d47e2ee`
  with file:line evidence — 21 STILL_PRESENT, 5 CHANGED, 2 COMPLETED_LATER
  (VB-04 and VD-05's rule @ `a784e668`), 3 follow-on defects CF-01..CF-03
  (1.3).

## Work In Progress

- **M2 (task 6.1) COMPLETE** — the repository formatter policy landed FIRST
  per RESUME_PROMPT §2: `biome.json` (formatter + organize-imports + linter
  off), `.editorconfig` pinning the normalizers off and declaring only the
  corpus byte invariants that hold, and `tests/unit/formatterPolicy.test.ts`
  5/5 with a positive control (formatter-enabled config rewrites the probe)
  and a whole-tracked-corpus `check --write` no-op over a disposable
  `git ls-files` copy with before/after hashes. The pinned
  `@biomejs/biome@2.5.14` installed offline (cache-only), the disposable
  `npm ci --offline` verification re-executed (10 packages, lockfile
  byte-identical), and dependency-currency + the matrix carry the honest
  advisory-scope limit. Focused suites green (formatterPolicy 5/5;
  nw14/nw08/executionClasses/nw07/c16 149/149 with the known clean-tree
  `projectState:2316` exception on the dirty worktree); hardening:check,
  handoff:check, agent:check and typecheck all PASS.
- Lint follow-through in the same checkpoint: the dead `loadTypeScriptModule`
  wrappers in `bin/ai-local-canary.mjs` and `bin/auth-configure.mjs` are
  removed (both call sites already use `loadRuntimeTypeScriptModule`
  directly) — this is the fix the harness autofix kept re-applying in
  canonical, now landing legitimately through the C-00 integrate.
- Next: M3 (group 2, tasks 2.1-2.8: VB-01..VB-07 certification anchors).

## Exact Next Action

Implement M3 (group 2, tasks 2.1-2.8): VB-01 (require a 40-hex evidenceSha
for PROVEN lanes with a value→null/class-change substantive classification),
VB-02 (artifactPaths + per-path `git cat-file -e <sha>:<path>` with
EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_ABSENT_AT_SHA), VB-03 (corrections guard archive-line
pairing + DECISIONS entry), VB-05 (close the legacy compatibility window;
HEAD invalid everywhere), VB-06 (checkpoint-role unit tests + stub-guard
probe + exclude guarded paths + remove the dead constant), VB-07 (real
per-file/total/stale-ceiling bin-typecheck ratchet). Then focused +
`gate:dev` + `gate:milestone` PASS, commit, and continue M4.

## Files Changed

| Path | Reason | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openspec/changes/nightwatch-final-completion-corrections-v1/` | corrective change contract (proposal/design/audit/tasks/specs) | restored unchanged into the worktree (bootstrap) |
| `openspec/changes/nightwatch-final-completion-corrections-v1/audit.md` | task 1.3 re-verification record at `1d47e2ee` | updated at bootstrap |
| `.agent/tasks/nightwatch-final-completion-corrections-v1/` | continuity v2 record for this child campaign | created at bootstrap |
| `.agent/ACTIVE_TASK.md` | active route to this child | flipped at bootstrap |
| `.agent/EXECUTION_PROMPT.md` | planner-executor handoff for this child | rewritten at bootstrap |

## Validation Ledger

Command: `npm run workspace:check` (canonical, pre-bootstrap)
Result: PASS
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant failure/output summary: `canonicalSafe=true`, clean tree at
`1d47e2ee`; the 16 owner-dispositioned files restored under RESUME_PROMPT
§1 authorization; pi-lens mutation controls disabled.

Command: re-verification of all 31 audit findings at `1d47e2ee` (read-only)
Result: PASS (recorded in `audit.md`'s re-verification table)
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant failure/output summary: 21 STILL_PRESENT, 5 CHANGED, 2
COMPLETED_LATER (VB-04 and VD-05's rule @ `a784e668`), 3 follow-on defects
(CF-01..CF-03) where later parent work built on a defective surface.

Command: `npm run agent:check` (this worktree, pre-bootstrap)
Result: PASS (pending this bootstrap commit's continuity headings)
When: 2026-09-28
Relevant failure/output summary: strict errors listed the missing
continuity headings (## Deferred Work, ## Completion Criteria, ## Files
Changed, ## Validation Ledger) — added before the bootstrap commit.

## Decisions Made During This Task

- (pending)

## Discoveries

- The 31 audit findings were re-verified at `1d47e2ee`; VB-04 and VD-05's
  rule landed in the parent's `a784e668` (COMPLETED_LATER) and 5 findings
  CHANGED shape. Three follow-on defects (CF-01/CF-02/CF-03) were recorded:
  later parent work (M5-M9) built on the VD-01/VD-03 foundations.

## Blockers

None.

## Safety Events

No Alphaus environment, database, cloud, credential, or external publication
contact; no sibling repository mutation; no force push or history rewrite;
all testing local/synthetic. External contact is OD-3 only. The owner
authorized one restore command (`git checkout -- <the 16 files>`) in
canonical on 2026-09-28 (RESUME_PROMPT §1); canonical was verified clean
afterwards.

## Deferred / Follow-Up

- The parent's M9-M14 work (10.2 remainder, 10.3-10.6, M10-M14) stays in
  the parent campaign after this child closes.

## Resume Recipe

Resume from this file: read `.agent/ACTIVE_TASK.md`, then this task's
`SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md`, `STATE.md`, and the change's `tasks.md`/`audit.md`;
reconcile against `git status` and the session record; run the smallest
decisive validation; continue the Next Action. All work happens in the
session worktree named in the routing block; integration is fast-forward
only; never write under the canonical checkout while this session is live.

## Completion Snapshot

Not complete. Terminal snapshot is written at close-out (task 6.4): every
finding dispositioned with evidence, ACTIVE_TASK routed back to the parent
at IN_PROGRESS with Next action "M9 task 10.2 remainder", and the change
archived with `--skip-specs`.
