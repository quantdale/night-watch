## Objective

Repair the bounded campaign budget starvation that blocked all four fresh
reproduction queues in the completed soak before replay executor entry, then
confirm a current candidate can traverse the real bounded replay/dossier path.

## Current Milestone

M0 — reconstruct and reproduce the budget starvation locally.

## Work In Progress

No executable change has yet been authorized by evidence beyond this task
activation. The completed soak remains historical and COMPLETE.

## Exact Next Action

Reconstruct current budget ownership and add a deterministic pre-fix regression
for the three-journey plus fresh-candidate reproduction-starvation case before
changing any budget value.

## Starting evidence

- Predecessor: nightwatch-dev-soak-replay-yield-v1 COMPLETE.
- Terminal: SOAK_COMPLETE_PRODUCT_CANDIDATES_REPLAY_INCONCLUSIVE.
- Fresh candidates: 8 across 4/5 full campaigns.
- Stable candidate fingerprints: 2.
- Reproduction queues: 4.
- Replay/minimization/dossier: 0/0/0.
- Shared blocker: journeyContexts already 3/3 before reproduction reservation.
- Safety: zero.
- Privacy: PASS.
